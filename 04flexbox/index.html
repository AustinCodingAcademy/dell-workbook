        <h2>Turbo Encabulator</h2>

            [From The Institute of Electrical Engineers, Students Quarterly Journal 25]

            For a number of years now, work has has been proceeding in order to bring
            prefection to the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would work to not
            only supply inverse reactive current, for use in unilateral phase detectors, but
            would also be capable of automatically synchronising cardinal grammeters.  Such
            a machine is the 'Turboencabulator'.  Basically, the only new principle involved
            is that instead of the power being generated by the relaxive motion of
            conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interactions of magneto-
            reluctance and capacitive directance.
            
            The original machine had a base-plate of prefabulated amulite, surrounded by a
            malleable logarithmic casing in such a way that the two spurving bearings were
            in direct line with the pentametric fan, the latter consisted simply of six
            hydrocoptic marzelvanes, so fitted to the ambifacient lunar vaneshaft that side
            fumbling was effectively prevented.  The main winding was of the normal lotus-
            o-delta type placed in panendermic semiboloid solts in the stator, every seventh
            conductor being connected by a non-reversible termic pipe to the differential
            girdlespring on the 'up' end of the grammeter.
            
            Forty-one manestically placed grouting brushes were arrranged to feed into the
            rotor slip stream a mixture of high S-value phenyhydrobenzamine and 5 percent
            reminative tetraiodohexamine.  Both these liquids have specific pericosities
            given by p=2.4 Cn where n is the diathecial evolute of retrograde temperature
            phase disposition and C is the Chomondeley's annual grillage coefficient.
            Initially, n was measured with the aid of a metapolar pilfrometer, but up to the
            present date nothing has been found to equal the transcetental hopper dadoscope.
            
            Electrical engineers will appreciate the difficulty of nubbing together a
            regurgitative purwell and a superaminative wennel-sprocket.  Indeed, this proved
            to be a stumbling block to further development until, in 1943, it was found that
            the use of anhydrous nagling pins enabled a kyptonastic boiling shim to be
            tankered.
            
            The early attempts to construct a sufficiently robust spiral decommutator failed
            largely because of lack of appreciation of the large quasi-pietic stresses in
            the gremlin studs; the latter were specially designed to hold the roffit bars to
            the spamshaft.  When, however, it was discovered that wending could be prevented
            by the simple addition of teeth to socket, almost perfect running was secured.
            
            The operating point is maintained as near as possible to the HF rem peak by
            constantly fromaging the bituminous spandrels.  This is a distinct advance on
            the standard nivelsheave in that no drammock oil is required after the phase
            detractors have remissed.
            
            Undoubtedly, the turboencabulator has now reached a very high level of technical
            development.  It has been successfully used for operating nofer trunnions.  In
            addition, whenever a barescent skor motion is required, it may be employed in
            conjunction with a drawn reciprocating dingle arm to reduce sinusoidal
            depleneration.
