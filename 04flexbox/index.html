                Teach your dog to skateboard. First, consider your dog's ability to skate and what tricks
                your dog will be able to do. Second, let your dog get used to being around a skatboard with
                simple interactions like sniffing it and being around it while stationary. Third, let your
                dog practice getting on and off the skateboard while stationary to develope muscle memory.
                Make sure to reward your dog with treats. Fourth, when your dog is on the skateboard, start 
                moving it slowly. Fifth, be safe and have fun!
