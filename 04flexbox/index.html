      <h2>TruboEncabulator</h2>
      <p>
        For a number of years now, work has has been proceeding in order to bring
        prefection to the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would work to not
        only supply inverse reactive current, for use in unilateral phase detectors, but
        would also be capable of automatically synchronising cardinal grammeters.  Such
        a machine is the 'Turboencabulator'.  Basically, the only new principle involved
        is that instead of the power being generated by the relaxive motion of
        conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interactions of magneto-
        reluctance and capacitive directance.
