          <h2>Turbo Encabulator</h2>

              [From The Institute of Electrical Engineers, Students Quarterly Journal 25]
  
              For a number of years now, work has has been proceeding in order to bring
              prefection to the crudely conceived idea of a machine that would work to not
              only supply inverse reactive current, for use in unilateral phase detectors, but
              would also be capable of automatically synchronising cardinal grammeters.  Such
              a machine is the 'Turboencabulator'.  Basically, the only new principle involved
              is that instead of the power being generated by the relaxive motion of
              conductors and fluxes, it is produced by the modial interactions of magneto-
              reluctance and capacitive directance.
              
              Undoubtedly, the turboencabulator has now reached a very high level of technical
              development.  It has been successfully used for operating nofer trunnions.  In
              addition, whenever a barescent skor motion is required, it may be employed in
              conjunction with a drawn reciprocating dingle arm to reduce sinusoidal
              depleneration.
