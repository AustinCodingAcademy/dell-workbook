            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro">I'm a user experience lead, digital strategy advisor and entrepreneur. Over the last 16 years I've moved between roles at private equity companies, angel-backed startups, and Fortune 100 companies. I currently work as a user experience lead at Dell Technologies.
            </p>

          <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p class="intro">In my role, I work with the engineering team and advocate for users and usability. As a Senior UX Architect at Dell Technologies, I'm responsible for the end-to-end design of complex cross-product features and experiences.

                            <p>I came to ServiceMaster to drive the digital blueprint for a portfolio company.

                              <p>Ecommerce at AutoZone was fun because I got to test hypothesis after hypothesis to drive ecommerce sales. I launched online marketing programs including email, affiliate, social media and search and introduced what became a 7 figure revenue stream with online advertising sales. I created and managed the online content calendar, the promo calendar, the deployment schedule and drove user experience.</p>
