    <h2><i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
      I was born at a young age in Toledo, Ohio. I lived in Ohio until I was 18 when I went to Maryland to study philosophy and think about thinking. 
      After a few years, I returned to my hometown and decided to pursue a less practical degree in Computer Science & Engineering. After graduating, 
      I received an offer from Dell which I quickly accepted. I moved to Texas, fell in love, and started a family.
