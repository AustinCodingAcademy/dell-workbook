        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <p>In my 20+ year career I have been fortunate to work at some amazing companies 
            (Dell Technologies, GSD&M Advertising, Electronic Arts, Sony Pictures Studios and Princess Cruises), 
            but even more fortunate to work with amazing people. I have developed a skill set 
            that includes excellent organization, multi-tasking, and customer service. 
            In addition, I bring a hybrid approach of technology and creatively focused talent. 
            Please look through my experience to see how I can help you.</p>
